									<p>Weather App using React.js

										I developed a dynamic weather application using React.js to provide users with real-time weather information. This project demonstrated my proficiency in front-end development, API integration, and state management within a modern web development framework.

										Key Features:

										User-friendly Interface: Designed an intuitive and responsive user interface that allows users to easily input a city name and receive weather updates.
										API Integration: Utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data based on the user's input. Incorporated the fetch function to send requests to the API and retrieve relevant weather details.
										Dynamic Updates: Leveraged React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and trigger updates whenever the user entered a new city name. This enabled the app to dynamically display accurate weather information in real time.
										Temperature Conversion: Implemented a feature that converts temperature units from Celsius to Fahrenheit for user convenience.
										Data Display: Structured and presented weather data in a clear format, including the city name, country, temperature, and a brief description of the weather conditions.
										Error Handling: Implemented error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the API request fails, providing users with appropriate feedback and preventing application crashes.
										Styling and UI/UX: Designed a visually appealing user interface with thoughtful layout and typography choices, ensuring a positive user experience across devices.
										Responsive Design: Ensured that the app is accessible and functional on various screen sizes and devices, enhancing usability for a wide range of users.
										<br />
										Technologies Used:
										
										React.js
										JSX (JavaScript XML) for component rendering
										ES6 syntax for modern JavaScript development
										CSS for styling and layout
										OpenWeatherMap API for weather data retrieval
										fetch function for making API requests
										useState and useEffect hooks for state management
										This project not only showcased my technical skills in building a functional and visually appealing web application but also demonstrated my ability to work with APIs and integrate external data seamlessly. Through this Weather App, I showcased my dedication to user-centered design and my commitment to delivering polished and engaging user experiences.
